Spring hat league 2016 wrapped up last week, so it's time to look at how my predictions fared!

Let's jump straight in with the money plot.  This diagram shows the average score differential per game for all of the teams in the "JP Mixed (4/3)" division of spring hat league.  In my last post, I ranked teams in both "JP Mixed (4/3)" and "Lexington Mixed (4/3) Weekend" divisions in a single list, which is why I had 30 teams listed in the previous post.
